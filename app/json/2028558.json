The calligraphy on this album leaf was inscribed by Fung Ming Chip (b. 1951; standard Mandarin transcription: Feng Mingqiu). The three columns at the right of the composition are the main text and are written in \"xingshu\", or cursive script; the four columns that occupy the remaining two-thirds of the composition are the signature and date and also are written in \"xingshu\", but in a manner the artist characterizes as Bold Black Script. The text itself comprises twenty characters in three columns, as follows:  eight characters in the right column; seven characters in the middle column; and five characters in the left column. The boldly written signature comprises fourteen characters in four columns, as follows:  three characters in the right column; four characters in the second column; three characters in the third column; and four characters in the left column. The leaf is dated to 2009 by inscription; for the numbers in the date, the artist used the elaborate characters that typically are reserved for official documents and business records. This album leaf includes three seals of the artist, which the artist himself carved; the seals and their locations can be described as follows: \r\n\r\nUpper right: Rectangular, red, relief seal reading \"Si Bu Guan\" (Artist’s studio name)\r\nMiddle left: Square, red, relief seal reading \"Ming Chip\" (Ming Qiu) (Artist’s given name)\r\nLower left: Square, red, relief seal reading \"Dui Cuo Yi Sheng\" (“Right and wrong in life”)\r\n\r\nThe inscribed text can be translated as follows:\r\nBecause of the void everything is possible. Without the void nothing is possible.\r\n\r\nThe dated artist signature reads: \r\nEr ling ling jiu nian Mingqiu shu yu Shenzhen Si Bu Guan\r\n\r\nThe signature can be translated as:\r\n[In the] year 2009, Ming Chip wrote [this] in [his] Si Bu Guan [i.e., Studio of the Four No’s] in Shenzhen\r\n\r\nThe three artist seals can be characterized as follows:\r\nUpper right: Rectangular, red, relief seal reading \"Si Bu Guan\" (Artist’s studio name)\r\nMiddle left: Square, red, relief seal reading \"Ming Chip\" (Ming Qiu) (Artist’s given name)\r\nLower left: Square, red, relief seal reading \"Dui Cuo Yi Sheng\" (“Right and wrong in life”)\r\n\r\nNote that the seal reading \"Si Bu Guan\" refers to the artist’s studio: the “Studio of the Four No’s”\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n","dateoflastpageview":"2016-04-06","dateoffirstpageview":"2011-10-20","primaryimageurl":"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUAM:DDC111167_dynmc","dated":"2009","contextualtextcount":0,"copyright":null,"period":null,"url":"http://harvardartmuseums.org/collections/object/336547","provenance":"Fung Ming Chip, Hong Kong (2009-2010), sold; to Susan L.

The character, which is better known in the West by the Japanese pronunciation \"Zen,\" refers to a meditative sect of Buddhism that claimed--and still claims--numerous adherents in both China and Japan. The text was composed and inscribed on this album leaf by Fung Ming Chip (standard Mandarin transcription: Feng Mingqiu). The upper two thirds of this album leaf is blank except for the seal impressed at the very top; the lower one third includes several broad brushstrokes in black ink, the network of brushstrokes resembling two stacked Z's. Written upside down, as if reflected from above, the single character is written in cursive, or running, script (xingshu) in a manner that the artist characterizes as \"reflection script.\" The artist created this calligraphic work by brushing the broad, black strokes and then, using a brush loaded with water, by inscribing the character within the upper portion of the net of brushstrokes, creating a work in which the character appears pale gray against the black strokes. The artist has stated that he intended to create a calligraphic work that resembles a pictorial, nighttime scene in which the moon--in this instance, the character chan--is reflected in a lake (i.e., the network of black brushstrokes at the bottom). This calligraphic work is not dated; however, the artist stated to the curator that he created it in 2009. This calligraphic work is not signed, but it includes one seal of the artist, which identifies it as a work of Fung Ming Chip. The seal, which the artist himself carved, can be described as follows:\r\n\r\nSquare, red, intaglio seal reading \"Xiang\"\r\n[Note:  The seal reading \"Xiang\" can be translated as \"Phenomenon\"]\r\n\r\n","dateoflastpageview":"2016-04-15","dateoffirstpageview":"2011-03-28","primaryimageurl":"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUAM:DDC111166_dynmc","colors":[{"percent":0.71965517241379,"spectrum":"#955ba5","color":"#e1e1e1","css3":"#dcdcdc","hue":"Grey"},{"percent":0.18563218390805,"spectrum":"#2eb45d","color":"#323232","css3":"#2f4f4f","hue":"Grey"},{"percent":0.050574712643678,"spectrum":"#3db657","color":"#4b4b4b","css3":"#2f4f4f","hue":"Grey"},{"percent":0.011149425287356,"spectrum":"#8c5fa8","color":"#c8c8c8","css3":"#c0c0c0","hue":"Grey"},{"percent":0.0093103448275862,"spectrum":"#8362aa","color":"#7d7d7d","css3":"#808080","hue":"Grey"},{"percent":0.0070114942528736,"spectrum":"#8c5fa8","color":"#afafaf","css3":"#a9a9a9","hue":"Grey"},{"percent":0.0067816091954023,"spectrum":"#7866ad","color":"#646464","css3":"#696969","hue":"Grey"},{"percent":0.0058620689655172,"spectrum":"#8761aa","color":"#969696","css3":"#a9a9a9","hue":"Grey"},{"percent":0.0018390804597701,"spectrum":"#e36769","color":"#e19696","css3":"#e9967a","hue":"Red"},{"percent":0.0010344827586207,"spectrum":"#cb5781","color":"#c87d7d","css3":"#bc8f8f","hue":"Red"}],"dated":"2009","contextualtextcount":0,"copyright":null,"period":null,"url":"http://harvardartmuseums.org/collections/object/336546","provenance":"Fung Ming Chip, Hong Kong (2009-2010), sold; to Susan L.

The character, which is better known in the West by the Japanese pronunciation \"Zen,\" refers to a meditative sect of Buddhism that claimed--and still claims--numerous adherents in both China and Japan. The text was composed and inscribed on this album leaf by Fung Ming Chip (standard Mandarin transcription: Feng Mingqiu). The character is written in cursive, or running, script (\"xingshu\") in a manner that the artist characterizes as \"splash script.\" The artist created this calligraphic work by splashing very wet, black ink at the top of the album leaf and then, using a brush loaded with water, by inscribing the character within the main and largest portion of the splash, creating a work in which the character appears pale gray against the black splash. Smaller dots of ink radiate out from the main splash. This calligraphic work is not dated; however, the artist stated to the curator that he created it in 2009. This calligraphic work is not signed, but it includes one seal of the artist, which identifies it as a work of Fung Ming Chip. The seal, which the artist himself carved, can be described as follows:\r\n\r\nSquare, red, relief seal reading \"Dui Cuo Yi Sheng\"\r\n[Note:  The seal reading Dui Cuo Yi Sheng can be translated as \"Right and wrong in life\"]","dateoflastpageview":"2016-06-01","dateoffirstpageview":"2011-02-03","primaryimageurl":"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUAM:DDC111165_dynmc","colors":[{"percent":0.94,"spectrum":"#955ba5","color":"#e1e1e1","css3":"#dcdcdc","hue":"Grey"},{"percent":0.018036529680365,"spectrum":"#2eb45d","color":"#323232","css3":"#2f4f4f","hue":"Grey"},{"percent":0.017625570776256,"spectrum":"#8c5fa8","color":"#c8c8c8","css3":"#c0c0c0","hue":"Grey"},{"percent":0.0073059360730594,"spectrum":"#8c5fa8","color":"#afafaf","css3":"#a9a9a9","hue":"Grey"},{"percent":0.004703196347032,"spectrum":"#3db657","color":"#4b4b4b","css3":"#2f4f4f","hue":"Grey"},{"percent":0.0046575342465753,"spectrum":"#8761aa","color":"#969696","css3":"#a9a9a9","hue":"Grey"},{"percent":0.00337899543379,"spectrum":"#8362aa","color":"#7d7d7d","css3":"#808080","hue":"Grey"},{"percent":0.0026027397260274,"spectrum":"#7866ad","color":"#646464","css3":"#696969","hue":"Grey"},{"percent":0.001689497716895,"spectrum":"#c15689","color":"#c89696","css3":"#bc8f8f","hue":"Red"}],"dated":"2009","contextualtextcount":0,"copyright":null,"period":null,"url":"http://harvardartmuseums.org/collections/object/336545","provenance":"Fung Ming Chip, Hong Kong (2009-2010), sold; to Susan L.
